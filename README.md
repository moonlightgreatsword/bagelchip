# bagelchip

Bagelchip is a game for two players in which one player must hide their precious caviar-covered chips in an array of plain bagel chips. To keep the covetous second player from eating all their caviar chips, they can also hide chips covered in spicy pepper jam. If player two finds all five caviar chips, they're the winner! But watch out: if you unearth three pepper chips first, you'll have to throw in the towel.
